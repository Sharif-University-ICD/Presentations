A presentation and document, describing NVLink-NVIDIAâ€™s high-speed interconnect technology for GPU-accelerated computing- in detail.

## Overview
Unlocking the full potential of exascale computing and trillion-parameter AI models hinges on the need for swift, seamless communication among every GPU within a server cluster. The latest generation of NVLink can scale up to 576 GPUs to accelerate performance for trillion- and multi-trillion-parameter AI models. Blackwell GPUs provide 1.8 TB/sec total bandwidth, 900GB/sec in each direction, which is over 14X the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5.
NVLink is high-bandwidth, energy-efficient, low-latency, lossless and includes resiliency features, such as link-level error detection and packet replay mechanisms to guarantee successful transmission of data.
