It has evolved over time to support higher resolutions, better sound quality, and advanced features such as HDCP encryption, ARC, and eARC. This presentation explores the working principles of HDMI, including TMDS encoding, synchronization signals (HSYNC & VSYNC), and security mechanisms like HDCP.
