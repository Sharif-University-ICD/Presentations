# LoRa: A Deep Dive into Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN)

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This repository contains a presentation on **LoRa (Long Range)** technology, a leading solution in **Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN)**. As the world transitions into an era of **massive IoT adoption**, LoRa provides a **scalable, energy-efficient, and long-range** communication method for various applications.

## ðŸ“– Presentation Overview
This presentation covers the following key aspects:

### ðŸ”¹ What is LoRa?
- The growing demand for **LPWAN** in IoT
- Comparison with **Sigfox, LTE-M, and NB-IoT**
- Use cases in **smart cities, healthcare, logistics, and agriculture**

### ðŸ”¹ LoRa Physical Layer (LoRa PHY)
- Modulation techniques: **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) & Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**
- Advantages: **long-range communication, low power consumption, resilience**
- Frequency modulation details and packet structure

### ðŸ”¹ LoRaWAN Link Layer
- **Network architecture:** Endpoints, Gateways, Network & Application Servers
- **Device Classes:** A (lowest power), B (scheduled downlink), C (always listening)
- Examples of **LoRaWAN-based sensors and devices**

### ðŸ”¹ LoRaBlink: A Multi-Hop Enhancement
- A proposed solution for **multi-hop communication**
- Key improvements: **Lower energy consumption, increased resilience, and low latency**
- Comparison between **LoRaWAN and LoRaBlink**
