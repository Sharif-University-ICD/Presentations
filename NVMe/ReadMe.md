## Overview
Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is a modern, high-performance storage protocol designed to unleash the full potential of PCI Express (PCIe)-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Unlike legacy protocols like AHCI/SATA, which were built for slower mechanical hard drives, NVMe addresses the bottlenecks of traditional storage interfaces by leveraging the parallelism and low-latency capabilities of PCIe and contemporary NAND flash architectures. This repository contains detailed technical documentation about:
- NVMe protocol specifications
- Signaling and Physical Layer
- Flow Control in NVMe
- Error Detection and Correction
- Messages Formats

## Key Features
- Detailed breakdown of NVMe architecture
- Comparison with legacy protocols (AHCI/SATA)
- Explanation of parallel I/O processing
