# Introduciton to InfiniBand

### Presented By: Mohammad Parsa Bashari (400104812)

In this presentation, we provide an introduction to an industry standard, channel-based, switched-fabric interconnect architecture, the InfiniBand, which is used for server and storage connectivity (used in HPC, AI, and could data centers). This protocol is used both for inter- and intra-computer communication and offers high data transfer rates, ranging from 10 to 400 Gb/s. InfiniBand also implements Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) to achieve a significant improvement in end-to-end delay.
