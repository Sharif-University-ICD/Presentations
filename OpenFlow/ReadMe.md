OpenFlow Presentation
<br>
**OpenFlow** is a protocol for **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** that separates the control and data planes. It allows a central **controller** to manage network switches dynamically. **Flow tables** in switches define how packets are forwarded. If a packet doesn't match existing rules, the switch queries the controller. OpenFlow enables **network programmability, flexibility, and efficiency**.
